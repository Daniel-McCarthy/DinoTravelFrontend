# DinoTravelFrontend

This repository holds the frontend source code for our DePaul University Computer Science capstone project where we constructed a flight booking application. It uses a combination of TypeScript and React to implement the website with NodeJS and Webpack for building and deployment of the website. The frontend was developed by [@Daniel-McCarthy](https://github.com/Daniel-McCarthy), [@clark61](https://github.com/clark61) and [@Dgawel77](https://github.com/Dgawel77) during the Winter quarter of 2021-2022.
